* neon-podcaster

A command line podcast client to listen to any podcast episode using rss. Written completely in python.

* Quick Start

*neon-podcaster* is a command line program/app to listen to any podcast channel episode.

** Display Options

  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -p          run the podcast client
  -b          build the podcast channel feed file
  -l L        provide the launcher to use (default: 'dmenu -l 20')
  -v V        provide the default volume to launch with (default: '30')
  -d          delete a podcast channel from the feed file.

** Requirements

 Before you start a few things are required in order for the program/app to work.

 - mpv should either be configured with ytdl hook or should be configured with the ytdlautoformat extension.

   check out this [[https://youtu.be/4wWI1iv4KEE][tutorial]] on how to add extensions in mpv.

 - python 3.8 or above should be installed from your distributions package manager.

**  Examples

*** build the podcast channel feed file by adding the podcast channels

#+begin_src shell
  neon-podcaster -b
#+end_src

[[file:images/build.png]]

*** delete a podcast channel from the feed file

#+begin_src shell
  neon-podcaster -d
#+end_src

Select the channel name you want to delete and press <Enter> and it will delete it for you.

*** run the podcast client

#+begin_src shell
  neon-podcaster -p
#+end_src

Select the channel from which you want to listen to.

[[file:images/select.png]]

After selecting just wait for a few seconds as it takes time to retrieve the rss feed, Then just select the episode you want to play.

[[file:images/select_the_episode.png]]

Then your selected episode should play as shown below.

*** choose a different launcher to use

#+begin_src shell
  neon-podcaster -p -l "rofi -dmenu"
#+end_src

[[file:images/different_launcher.png]]

*** change the default volume with which the podcast should play

#+begin_src shell
  neon-podcaster -p -v 50
#+end_src

*** change the volume after it has begun playing the episode

 Since the app/program uses mpv as the backend to play podcast episodes it uses the same keyboard shortcuts as mpv uses.

 such as:

 0,9 -- to increase and decrease volume,
 p -- to pause,
 m -- to mute,
 etc.

* Backup

If you want to backup your podcast feed list file. The file can be found at */home/$USER/.config/neonPodcaster/feeds.csv*. 
 
* Installation

** Arch Linux

The package is available in the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/neon-podcaster-git][aur]] and in neon-os (arch distro) repo

#+begin_src shell
  paru -S neon-podcaster-git
#+end_src

Or

add the following lines in the pacman.conf.

#+begin_src text
  [neon-os-core-repo]
  SigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional
  Server = https://gitlab.com/NEON-MMD/$repo/-/raw/main/$arch
#+end_src

*Important:* add the key server, recieve the keys and sign the keys locally. 

#+begin_src shell
  grep -qxF "keyserver.ubuntu.com:80" /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf || echo "keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf
  grep -qxF "keyserver.ubuntu.com:443" /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf || echo "keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf
  sudo pacman-key --recv-key 51F9A14D1DEE561A
  sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 51F9A14D1DEE561A
#+end_src

Sync the repository before installing it and also during the sync process it will complain about missing Keys. It is normal and accept the prompt to import it and you are good to go :).

#+begin_src shell
  sudo pacman -S neon-podcaster-git
#+end_src
